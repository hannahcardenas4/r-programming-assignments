## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Narrative paragraph

This document represents example usage of the R Markdown feature. The purpose of it is to practice R Markdown authoring and document structure, embedding R code, narrative text, and LaTeX math in a single file. It will also include a thoughtful reflection regarding the workflow vs. writing plain reports.

## LaTeX math expression

Here I practiced using LaTeX math expressions both inline and on their own lines. For example:

This is the inline equation for the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, 

And here is the same equation displayed on its own line:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

## Executable R code chunks

Here I wrote simple R code chunks to load ggplot and create simple scatterplot using the built in mtcars dataset. The plot shows car weight (wt) vs miles per gallon (mpg).
```{r load_ggplot, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r run_ggplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Reflection

R Markdown is a very useful format to generating a report. I like that you can easily embed plots or formulas without showing the code that was used to create them using the "echo=FALSE" line. Additionally, the section headers and narrative chunks are very easy to distinguish when writing the actual document. However, I would say that because there are both R code and narrative chunks, the process before knitting can look a bit overwhelming and may be a little difficult to keep track of. I found myself consistently editing, knitting, reviewing formatting, and then editing again since the rendered output does not exactly match what is written. That being said, I believe it provides a cleaner final report, but requires more work on the back-end.
